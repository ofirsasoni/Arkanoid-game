# Arkanoid-game
I created an arkanoid game using java programing language.
The game includes multiple levels in different difficultis, and the user can choose which level to play. There are also many features in the game that makes it more accessible and easier to play, such as:
1) Pause button so you can pause the game where ever you want.
2) Score counter so you can compare your best score with your friends' best score.
3) Many lives, so you can revive after dieing one time.
4) 3,2,1 counter every time you start a new level, so you have time to prepare your self to the new level.
